CURRENT ISSUES: 
------------------
- Cannot process list of lists in TARGET

TO DO: 
------
1. Get optional command line args that use the defaults if not specified.
2. Output the data to the Device object. (Dump existing dict to object via FOR loop?)
3. Write the CSV doc from the devices objects instead of the current dictionary.
